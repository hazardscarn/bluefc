"""
Brand Analysis Agent Package

This package provides comprehensive brand analysis capabilities using Qloo API
and Google ADK agents.

ADK Structure:
- agent.py: Main agents including root_agent (required by ADK)
- subagent.py: Sub-agents to avoid circular imports
- tools.py: All tool functions for brand analysis workflow

For ADK Web Interface:
- The root_agent is automatically discovered by ADK
- Use root_agent for main brand analysis workflow
- All session management and runners are configured automatically
